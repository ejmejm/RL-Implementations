# Ludus

Ludus is a reinforcement learning library for expediating development of RL applications and research. Ludus is still in development at the alpha stage, and new algorithms and models are continuously being added with the growth of the framework. You can find most state-of-the-art algorithms implemented and ready to use. Additionly, the platform has ready to go integration with popular training environments like OpenAI's [gym](https://gym.openai.com/). The high level api of Ludus combined with easily accesible and well documented, open sourced code base allows for both efficiency and control.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you quickly get Ludus up and running, ready for RL application. Ludus is built on Python 3, and there is no gaurantee it will work with Python 2.

### Prerequisites

Ludus requires several libraries to get started. Anaconda 3 is recommended as it contains most of the required libraries.
These libraries can be installed with the following commands:

- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy): `pip install numpy`
- [opencv2](https://github.com/opencv/opencv): `pip install opencv-python`
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow): `pip install tensorflow` OR `pip install tensorflow-gpu`*
- [gym](https://gym.openai.com/): `pip install gym`

\* Tensorflow with GPU support is highly recommended but requires extra steps that are documented on the Tensorflow website.

### Installing

Currently the library can be installed by cloning the repository, and moving it to a location in your Python path. More on easier installation to come.
